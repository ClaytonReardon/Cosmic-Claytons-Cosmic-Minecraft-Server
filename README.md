## Mods
- These are moslty performance optimization and quality of life mods
- *Except* for [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric)
    - Watch the video above if you wanna shit
    - Create is like what redstone should have been
    - It allows you to automate and build crazy things, but it's far more understandable, *far* better explained in-game, and looks way cooler than redstone
    - Still challening and complicated though, it is not an easy mode
    - [Just Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) also has to be installed for Create to work
    - [WTHIT (What The Hell Is That)](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit) tells you in game the name of the block you're looking at, helpful when dealing with new Create blocks
- [ItemSwapper](https://modrinth.com/plugin/itemswapper) and [Inmis](https://modrinth.com/mod/inmis)
    - Together, these things are the **Inventory Update** everyone has been begging for. In my mind, this should be in Vanilla
    - **Inmis (I Need More Inventory Space)** 
        - lets you craft backpacks, with increasingly large capacity for more rare materials
        - The backpacks can be conveniently opened with the **b** key, and you can swap items between your invetory and the backpack
        - The [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) mod allows the backpack to be equipped to a dedicated *"backpack"* armor slot
    - **ItemSwapper**
        - A game changer. Press the **r** key and you can hotswap to all blocks related to the one selected in your hotbar that are in your inventory ***or*** in shulker boxes.
        - It's also *really* convenient to swap to other blocks unrelated to your selected block.
