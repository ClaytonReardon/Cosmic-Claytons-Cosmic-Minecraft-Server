## Mods
- These are moslty performance optimization and quality of life mods
- *Except* for [Create](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-fabric)
    - Watch the video above if you wanna shit
    - Create is like what redstone should have been
    - It allows you to automate and build crazy things, but it's far more understandable, *far* better explained in-game, and looks way cooler than redstone
    - Still challening and complicated though, it is not an easy mode
    - [Just Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/jei) also has to be installed for Create to work
    - [WTHIT (What The Hell Is That)](https://modrinth.com/mod/wthit) tells you in game the name of the block you're looking at, helpful when dealing with new Create blocks
- [ItemSwapper](https://modrinth.com/plugin/itemswapper) and [Inmis](https://modrinth.com/mod/inmis)
    - Together, these things are the **Inventory Update** everyone has been begging for. In my mind, this should be in Vanilla
    - **Inmis (I Need More Inventory Space)** 
        - lets you craft backpacks, with increasingly large capacity for more rare materials
        - The backpacks can be conveniently opened with the **b** key, and you can swap items between your invetory and the backpack
        - The [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) mod allows the backpack to be equipped to a dedicated *"backpack"* armor slot
    - **ItemSwapper**
        - A game changer. Press the **r** key and you can hotswap to all blocks related to the one selected in your hotbar that are in your inventory ***or*** in shulker boxes.
        - It's also *really* convenient to swap to other blocks unrelated to your selected block.

## Resource Pack
- The resource pack is from [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/) which is a great site that lets you customize a resource pack for yourself from a bunch of quality of life tweaks. These are most of my favorite settings without differing too much from Vanilla
- The number one thing this does which I love is the *"UniversalLushGrass"* tweak, which makes grass greener and lusher all around. No more depressing washed out mountain grass, or gross brown savannah grass. Makes more biomes viable as base locations.
- You can also upload this pack to the site and remove or add the tweaks I've made

## MultiMC
*[Download Link](https://multimc.org/#Download)*
- MultiMC is an alternative Minecraft launcher. It makes it super easy to have different installations of Minecraft running different versions, with different sets of mods, resource packs and worlds. It also makes it about a million times easier to install modpacks.
    - Installing modpacks through the vanilla launcher is a giant pain in the ass without using some cringepilled third party app like Curseforge or Modrinth where you have to make some whole account and it's just like ugh sir. And then if you want to install additional mods on top of the modpack it's also stupid and cringe and it's just like bruh why.
- It's also really easy to install. It's just a zip file. Extract it wherever you want and make a shortcut to MultiMC.exe and put in your desktop
